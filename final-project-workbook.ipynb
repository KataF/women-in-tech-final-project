    "The plan of this project is to explore the dataset and by doing so learn how to best analyse and visualize its contents. The main aims of the project are as follows:\n"
    "\n",
    "- We explore any interesting correlations found in the datasets\n"
    "- We measure female to male ratio in companies in general\n"
    "- We take a look at female to male ratio in companies as sorted by their various categories\n"
    "- We determine in which company category the number of females is the highest\n"
    "- We explore the effects, if any, of company funding to female to male ratio\n"

    "In addition to the main aims there may be other findings found during the data exploration. These additional findings will be included in the report as well.\n"
